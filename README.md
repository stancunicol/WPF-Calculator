# üßÆ WPF Calculator App

A Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) calculator built in C#, designed to replicate the standard Windows calculator (Standard + partially Programmer mode). This application demonstrates core concepts of desktop application development in WPF, including UI design, memory operations, and persistence of settings.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- ‚úÖ **Basic arithmetic operations**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `‚àö`, `x¬≤`, `¬±`, `1/x`
- ‚úÖ **Memory functions**: `MC`, `MR`, `MS`, `M+`, `M-`, and memory stack display (`M>`)
- ‚úÖ **Editing tools**: `Backspace`, `CE` (clear entry), `C` (clear all)
- ‚úÖ **Clipboard operations**: `Cut`, `Copy`, `Paste` ‚Äì custom string-based, not using built-in control functionality
- ‚úÖ **Digit grouping**: numbers formatted with group separators based on current culture (`1.000` in RO, `1,000` in EN)
- ‚úÖ **Programmer mode**:
  - Base conversions between Binary (2), Octal (8), Decimal (10), Hexadecimal (16) (the keyboards are disabled based on the current base)
  - Input validation based on selected base
  - Display only is affected by the base; calculations are still in decimal
- ‚úÖ **User settings persistence**:
  - Last used calculator mode (Standard or Programmer)
  - Last used number base in Programmer mode
  - Digit grouping preference
- ‚úÖ **Keyboard and mouse input support**
- ‚úÖ **Non-resizable calculator window**
- ‚úÖ **Read-only result display**
- ‚úÖ **Help > About** menu with student info

> ‚ùó **Note**: Operation order (precedence) is **not** implemented. The calculator evaluates expressions sequentially as entered (left-to-right, cascade style). For example, `2 + 3 * 4` results in `20` instead of `14`.
